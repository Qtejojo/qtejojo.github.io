# Zero-Shot Prompting


Large language models (LLMs) today, such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude 3, are tuned to follow instructions and are trained on large amounts of data. Large-scale training makes these models capable of performing some tasks in a "zero-shot" manner. Zero-shot prompting means that the prompt used to interact with the model won't contain examples or demonstrations. The zero-shot prompt directly instructs the model to perform a task without any additional examples to steer it.

We tried a few zero-shot examples in the previous section. Here is one of the examples (ie., text classification) we used:

*Prompt:*
```
Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. 

Text: I think the vacation is okay.
Sentiment:
```

*Output:*
```
Neutral
```

Note that in the prompt above we didn't provide the model with any examples of text alongside their classifications, the LLM already understands "sentiment" -- that's the zero-shot capabilities at work. 

Instruction tuning has been shown to improve zero-shot learning [Wei et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01652.pdf). Instruction tuning is essentially the concept of finetuning models on datasets described via instructions. Furthermore, [RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741) (reinforcement learning from human feedback) has been adopted to scale instruction tuning wherein the model is aligned to better fit human preferences. This recent development powers models like ChatGPT. We will discuss all these approaches and methods in upcoming sections.

When zero-shot doesn't work, it's recommended to provide demonstrations or examples in the prompt which leads to few-shot prompting. In the next section, we demonstrate few-shot prompting.


# Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

For complex tasks that require exploration or strategic lookahead, traditional or simple prompting techniques fall short. [Yao et el. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) and [Long (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08291) recently proposed Tree of Thoughts (ToT), a framework that generalizes over chain-of-thought prompting and encourages exploration over thoughts that serve as intermediate steps for general problem solving with language models.

ToT maintains a tree of thoughts, where thoughts represent coherent language sequences that serve as intermediate steps toward solving a problem. This approach enables an LM to self-evaluate the progress through intermediate thoughts made towards solving a problem through a deliberate reasoning process. The LM's ability to generate and evaluate thoughts is then combined with search algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search and depth-first search) to enable systematic exploration of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking.

The ToT framework is illustrated below:

When using ToT, different tasks requires defining the number of candidates and the number of thoughts/steps. For instance, as demonstrated in the paper, Game of 24 is used as a mathematical reasoning task which requires decomposing the thoughts into 3 steps, each involving an intermediate equation. At each step, the best b=5 candidates are kept.

To perform BFS in ToT for the Game of 24 task, the LM is prompted to evaluate each thought candidate as "sure/maybe/impossible" with regard to reaching 24. As stated by the authors, "the aim is to promote correct partial solutions that can be verdicted within few lookahead trials, and eliminate impossible partial solutions based on "too big/small" commonsense, and keep the rest "maybe"". Values are sampled 3 times for each thought. The process is illustrated below:

<Screenshot src={TOT2} alt="TOT2" />
Image Source: [Yao et el. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601)

From the results reported in the figure below, ToT substantially outperforms the other prompting methods:

<Screenshot src={TOT3} alt="TOT3" />
Image Source: [Yao et el. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601)

Code available [here](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm) and [here](https://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver)

At a high level, the main ideas of [Yao et el. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) and [Long (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08291) are similar. Both enhance LLM's capability for complex problem solving through tree search via a multi-round conversation. One of the main difference is that [Yao et el. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) leverages DFS/BFS/beam search, while the tree search strategy (i.e. when to backtrack and backtracking by how many levels, etc.) proposed in [Long (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08291) is driven by a "ToT Controller" trained through reinforcement learning. DFS/BFS/Beam search are generic solution search strategies with no adaptation to specific problems. In comparison, a ToT Controller trained through RL might be able learn from new data set or through self-play (AlphaGo vs brute force search), and hence the RL-based ToT system can continue to evolve and learn new knowledge even with a fixed LLM.

[Hulbert (2023)](https://github.com/dave1010/tree-of-thought-prompting) has proposed Tree-of-Thought Prompting, which applies the main concept from ToT frameworks as a simple prompting technique, getting the LLM to evaluate intermediate thoughts in a single prompt. A sample ToT prompt is:

```
Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
then share it with the group.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
The question is...
```

[Sun (2023)](https://github.com/holarissun/PanelGPT) benchmarked the Tree-of-Thought Prompting with large-scale experiments, and introduce PanelGPT --- an idea of prompting with Panel discussions among LLMs.


# Reflexion

Reflexion is a framework to reinforce language-based agents through linguistic feedback. According to [Shinn et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366.pdf), "Reflexion is a new paradigm for ‘verbal‘ reinforcement that parameterizes a policy as an agent’s memory encoding paired with a choice of LLM parameters." 

At a high level, Reflexion converts feedback (either free-form language or scalar) from the environment into linguistic feedback, also referred to as **self-reflection**, which is provided as context for an LLM agent in the next episode. This helps the agent rapidly and effectively learn from prior mistakes leading to performance improvements on many advanced tasks.  

!["Reflexion Framework"](../../img/research/reflexion.png)

As shown in the figure above, Reflexion consists of three distinct models: 

- **An Actor**: Generates text and actions based on the state observations. The Actor takes an action in an environment and receives an observation which results in a trajectory. [Chain-of-Thought (CoT)](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot) and [ReAct](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react) are used as Actor models. A memory component is also added to provide additional context to the agent.
- **An Evaluator**: Scores outputs produced by the Actor. Concretely, it takes as input a generated trajectory (also denoted as short-term memory) and outputs a reward score. Different reward functions are used depending on the task (LLMs and rule-based heuristics are used for decision-making tasks). 
- **Self-Reflection**: Generates verbal reinforcement cues to assist the Actor in self-improvement. This role is achieved by an LLM and provides valuable feedback for future trials. To generate specific and relevant feedback, which is also stored in memory, the self-reflection model makes use of the reward signal, the current trajectory, and its persistent memory. These experiences (stored in long-term memory) are leveraged by the agent to rapidly improve decision-making.

In summary, the key steps of the Reflexion process are a) define a task, b) generate a trajectory, c) evaluate, d) perform reflection, and e) generate the next trajectory. The figure below demonstrates examples of how a Reflexion agent can learn to iteratively optimize its behavior to solve various tasks such as decision-making, programming, and reasoning. Reflexion extends the ReAct framework by introducing self-evaluation, self-reflection and memory components.

!["Reflexion Examples"](../../img/research/reflexion-examples.png)

## Results

Experimental results demonstrate that Reflexion agents significantly improve performance on decision-making AlfWorld tasks, reasoning questions in HotPotQA, and Python programming tasks on HumanEval. 

When evaluated on sequential decision-making (AlfWorld) tasks, ReAct + Reflexion significantly outperforms ReAct by completing 130/134 tasks using self-evaluation techniques of Heuristic and GPT for binary classification.

!["Reflexion ALFWorld Results"](../../img/research/reflexion-alfworld.png)

Reflexion significantly outperforms all baseline approaches over several learning steps. For reasoning only and when adding an episodic memory consisting of the most recent trajectory, Reflexion + CoT outperforms CoT only and CoT with episodic memory, respectively. 

!["Reflexion ALFWorld Results"](../../img/research/reflexion-hotpotqa.png)

As summarized in the table below, Reflexion generally outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches on Python and Rust code writing on MBPP, HumanEval, and Leetcode Hard.

!["Reflexion ALFWorld Results"](../../img/research/reflexion-programming.png)


## When to Use Reflexion?

Reflexion is best suited for the following:

1. **An agent needs to learn from trial and error**: Reflexion is designed to help agents improve their performance by reflecting on past mistakes and incorporating that knowledge into future decisions. This makes it well-suited for tasks where the agent needs to learn through trial and error, such as decision-making, reasoning, and programming.

2. **Traditional reinforcement learning methods are impractical**: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often require extensive training data and expensive model fine-tuning. Reflexion offers a lightweight alternative that doesn't require fine-tuning the underlying language model, making it more efficient in terms of data and compute resources.

3. **Nuanced feedback is required**: Reflexion utilizes verbal feedback, which can be more nuanced and specific than scalar rewards used in traditional RL. This allows the agent to better understand its mistakes and make more targeted improvements in subsequent trials.

4. **Interpretability and explicit memory are important**: Reflexion provides a more interpretable and explicit form of episodic memory compared to traditional RL methods. The agent's self-reflections are stored in its memory, allowing for easier analysis and understanding of its learning process.

Reflexion is effective in the following tasks:

- **Sequential decision-making**: Reflexion agents improve their performance in AlfWorld tasks, which involve navigating through various environments and completing multi-step objectives.
- **Reasoning**: Reflexion improved the performance of agents on HotPotQA, a question-answering dataset that requires reasoning over multiple documents.
- **Programming**: Reflexion agents write better code on benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, achieving state-of-the-art results in some cases.

Here are some limitations of Reflexion:

- **Reliance on self-evaluation capabilities**: Reflexion relies on the agent's ability to accurately evaluate its performance and generate useful self-reflections. This can be challenging, especially for complex tasks but it's expected that Reflexion gets better over time as models keep improving in capabilities.
- **Long-term memory constraints**: Reflexion makes use of a sliding window with maximum capacity but for more complex tasks it may be advantageous to use advanced structures such as vector embedding or SQL databases. 
- **Code generation limitations**: There are limitations to test-driven development in specifying accurate input-output mappings (e.g., non-deterministic generator function and function outputs influenced by hardware).

# ReAct Prompting

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

import REACT from '../../img/react.png'

import REACT2 from '../../img/react/alfworld.png'

[Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) introduced a framework named ReAct where LLMs are used to generate both *reasoning traces* and *task-specific actions* in an interleaved manner. 

Generating reasoning traces allow the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions. The action step allows to interface with and gather information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments.

The ReAct framework can allow LLMs to interact with external tools to retrieve additional information that leads to more reliable and factual responses.

Results show that ReAct can outperform several state-of-the-art baselines on language and decision-making tasks. ReAct also leads to improved human interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs. Overall, the authors found that best approach uses ReAct combined with chain-of-thought (CoT) that allows use of both internal knowledge and external information obtained during reasoning. 


## How it Works?

ReAct is inspired by the synergies between "acting" and "reasoning" which allow humans to learn new tasks and make decisions or reasoning. 

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has shown the capabilities of LLMs to carry out reasoning traces to generate answers to questions involving arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, among other tasks [(Wei et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903). But its lack of access to the external world or inability to update its knowledge can lead to issues like fact hallucination and error propagation. 

ReAct is a general paradigm that combines reasoning and acting with LLMs. ReAct prompts LLMs to generate verbal reasoning traces and actions for a task. This allows the system to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust plans for acting while also enabling interaction to external environments (e.g., Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into the reasoning. The figure below shows an example of ReAct and the different steps involved to perform question answering.

<Screenshot src={REACT} alt="REACT" />
Image Source: [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

In the example above, we pass a prompt like the following question from [HotpotQA](https://hotpotqa.github.io/):

```
Aside from the Apple Remote, what other devices can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with?
```

Note that in-context examples are also added to the prompt but we exclude that here for simplicity. We can see that the model generates *task solving trajectories* (Thought, Act). Obs corresponds to observation from the environment that's being interacted with (e.g., Search engine). In essence, ReAct can retrieve information to support reasoning, while reasoning helps to target what to retrieve next.  

## ReAct Prompting
To demonstrate how ReAct prompting works, let's follow an example from the paper. 

The first step is to select cases from a training set (e.g., HotPotQA) and compose ReAct-format trajectories. These are used as few-shot exemplars in the prompts. The trajectories consist of multiple thought-action-observation steps as shown in the figure above. The free-form thoughts are used to achieve different tasks such as decomposing questions, extracting information, performing commonsense/arithmetic reasoning, guide search formulation, and synthesizing final answer. 

Here is an example of what the ReAct prompt exemplars look like (obtained from the paper and shortened to one example for simplicity): 

```
Question What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the
Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought 1 I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector
of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the
area.
Action 1 Search[Colorado orogeny]
Observation 1 The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in
Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought 2 It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern
sector.
Action 2 Lookup[eastern sector]
Observation 2 (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called
the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought 3 The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I
need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action 3 Search[High Plains]
Observation 3 High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought 4 I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action 4 Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation 4 The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the
High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130
m).[3]
Thought 5 High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer
is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Action 5 Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]
...
```

Note that different prompts setups are used for different types of tasks. For tasks where reasoning is of primary importance (e.g., HotpotQA), multiple thought-action-observation steps are used for the task-solving trajectory. For decision making tasks involving lots of action steps, thoughts are used sparsely.  

## Results on Knowledge-Intensive Tasks

The paper first evaluates ReAct on knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks such as question answering (HotPotQA) and fact verification ([Fever](https://fever.ai/resources.html)). PaLM-540B is used as the base model for prompting. 

<Screenshot src={REACT1} alt="REACT1" />
Image Source: [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

The prompting results on HotPotQA and Fever using different prompting methods show that ReAct generally performs better than Act (involves acting only) on both tasks. 

We can also observe that ReAct outperforms CoT on Fever and lags behind CoT on HotpotQA. A detailed error analysis is provided in the paper. In summary:

- CoT suffers from fact hallucination
- ReAct's structural constraint reduces its flexibility in formulating reasoning steps
- ReAct depends a lot on the information it's retrieving; non-informative search results derails the model reasoning and leads to difficulty in recovering and reformulating thoughts

Prompting methods that combine and support switching between ReAct and CoT+Self-Consistency generally outperform all the other prompting methods. 

## Results on Decision Making Tasks

The paper also reports results demonstrating ReAct's performance on decision making tasks. ReAct is evaluated on two benchmarks called [ALFWorld](https://alfworld.github.io/) (text-based game) and [WebShop](https://webshop-pnlp.github.io/) (online shopping website environment). Both involve complex environments that require reasoning to act and explore effectively. 

Note that the ReAct prompts are designed differently for these tasks while still keeping the same core idea of combining reasoning and acting. Below is an example for an ALFWorld problem involving ReAct prompting. 

<Screenshot src={REACT2} alt="REACT2" />
Image Source: [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

ReAct outperforms Act on both ALFWorld and Webshop. Act, without any thoughts, fails to correctly decompose goals into subgoals. Reasoning seems to be advantageous in ReAct for these types of tasks but current prompting-based methods are still far from the performance of expert humans on these tasks. 

Check out the paper for more detailed results.

## LangChain ReAct Usage

Below is a high-level example of how the ReAct prompting approach works in practice. We will be using OpenAI for the LLM and [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) as it already has built-in functionality that leverages the ReAct framework to build agents that perform tasks by combining the power of LLMs and different tools. 

First, let's install and import the necessary libraries:

``` python
%%capture
# update or install the necessary libraries
!pip install --upgrade openai
!pip install --upgrade langchain
!pip install --upgrade python-dotenv
!pip install google-search-results

# import libraries
import openai
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# load API keys; you will need to obtain these if you haven't yet
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("SERPER_API_KEY")

```

Now we can configure the LLM, the tools we will use, and the agent that allows us to leverage the ReAct framework together with the LLM and tools. Note that we are using a search API for searching external information and LLM as a math tool. 

``` python
llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-003" ,temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["google-serper", "llm-math"], llm=llm)
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)
```

Once that's configured, we can now run the agent with the desired query/prompt. Notice that here we are not expected to provide few-shot exemplars as explained in the paper. 

``` python
agent.run("Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?")
```

The chain execution looks as follows:

``` yaml
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out who Olivia Wilde's boyfriend is and then calculate his age raised to the 0.23 power.
Action: Search
Action Input: "Olivia Wilde boyfriend"
Observation: Olivia Wilde started dating Harry Styles after ending her years-long engagement to Jason Sudeikis — see their relationship timeline.
Thought: I need to find out Harry Styles' age.
Action: Search
Action Input: "Harry Styles age"
Observation: 29 years
Thought: I need to calculate 29 raised to the 0.23 power.
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 29^0.23
Observation: Answer: 2.169459462491557

Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde's boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557.

> Finished chain.
```

The output we get is as follows:

```
"Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde's boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557."
```

We adapted the example from the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react), so credit goes to them. We encourage the learner to explore different combination of tools and tasks.

# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

import {Cards, Card} from 'nextra-theme-docs'

import {CodeIcon} from 'components/icons'

import RAG from '../../img/rag.png'
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

General-purpose language models can be fine-tuned to achieve several common tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. These tasks generally don't require additional background knowledge.

For more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks, it's possible to build a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources to complete tasks. This enables more factual consistency, improves reliability of the generated responses, and helps to mitigate the problem of "hallucination". 

Meta AI researchers introduced a method called [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/) to address such knowledge-intensive tasks. RAG combines an information retrieval component with a text generator model. RAG can be fine-tuned and its internal knowledge can be modified in an efficient manner and without needing retraining of the entire model. 

RAG takes an input and retrieves a set of relevant/supporting documents given a source (e.g., Wikipedia). The documents are concatenated as context with the original input prompt and fed to the text generator which produces the final output. This makes RAG adaptive for situations where facts could evolve over time. This is very useful as LLMs's parametric knowledge is static. RAG allows language models to bypass retraining, enabling access to the latest information for generating reliable outputs via retrieval-based generation.

Lewis et al., (2021) proposed a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for RAG. A pre-trained seq2seq model is used as the parametric memory and a dense vector index of Wikipedia is used as non-parametric memory (accessed using a neural pre-trained retriever). Below is a overview of how the approach works:

<Screenshot src={RAG} alt="RAG" />
Image Source: [Lewis et el. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf) 

RAG performs strong on several benchmarks such as [Natural Questions](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions), [WebQuestions](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/webquestions), and CuratedTrec. RAG generates responses that are more factual, specific, and diverse when tested on MS-MARCO and Jeopardy questions. RAG also improves results on FEVER fact verification.

This shows the potential of RAG as a viable option for enhancing outputs of language models in knowledge-intensive tasks. 

More recently, these retriever-based approaches have become more popular and are combined with popular LLMs like ChatGPT to improve capabilities and factual consistency.

# Prompt Chaining

import {Screenshot} from 'components/screenshot'
import PC1 from '../../img/prompt_chaining/prompt-chaining-1.png'

## Introduction to Prompt Chaining

To improve the reliability and performance of LLMs, one of the important prompt engineering techniques is to break tasks into its subtasks. Once those subtasks have been identified, the LLM is prompted with a subtask and then its response is used as input to another prompt. This is what's referred to as prompt chaining, where a task is split into subtasks with the idea to create a chain of prompt operations.

Prompt chaining is useful to accomplish complex tasks which an LLM might struggle to address if prompted with a very detailed prompt. In prompt chaining, chain prompts perform transformations or additional processes on the generated responses before reaching a final desired state. 

Besides achieving better performance, prompt chaining helps to boost the transparency of your LLM application, increases controllability, and reliability. This means that you can debug problems with model responses much more easily and analyze and improve performance in the different stages that need improvement.

Prompt chaining is particularly useful when building LLM-powered conversational assistants and improving the personalization and user experience of your applications. 

## Use Cases for Prompt Chaining

### Prompt Chaining for Document QA

Prompt chaining can be used in different scenarios that could involve several operations or transformations. For instance, one common use case of LLMs involves answering questions about a large text document. It helps if you design two different prompts where the first prompt is responsible for extracting relevant quotes to answer a question and a second prompt takes as input the quotes and original document to answer a given question. In other words, you will be creating two different prompts to perform the task of answering a question given in a document.

The first prompt below extracts the relevant quotes from the document given the question. Note that for simplicity, we have added a placeholder for the document `{{document}}`. To test the prompt you can copy and paste an article from Wikipedia such as this page for [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering). Due to larger context used for this task, we are using the `gpt-4-1106-preview` model from OpenAI. You can use the prompt with other long-context LLMs like Claude. 

Prompt 1: 
```
You are a helpful assistant. Your task is to help answer a question given in a document. The first step is to extract quotes relevant to the question from the document, delimited by ####. Please output the list of quotes using <quotes></quotes>. Respond with "No relevant quotes found!" if no relevant quotes were found.


####
{{document}}
####
```

Here is a screenshot of the entire prompt including the question which is passed using the `user` role.

<Screenshot src={PC1} alt="Prompt Chaining Part 1" />

The quotes that were returned in the first prompt can now be used as input to the second prompt below. Note that you can clean up the quotes a bit more, i.e., remove the citations. Those citations could be removed or utilized as part of another prompt in the chain but you can ignore this for now. The second prompt then takes the relevant quotes extracted by prompt 1 and prepares a helpful response to the question given in the document and those extracted quotes. The second prompt can be the following:

Prompt 2:
```
Given a set of relevant quotes (delimited by <quotes></quotes>) extracted from a document and the original document (delimited by ####), please compose an answer to the question. Ensure that the answer is accurate, has a friendly tone, and sounds helpful.

As you can see, simplifying and creating prompt chains is a useful prompting approach where the responses need to undergo several operations or transformations. As an exercise, feel free to design a prompt that removes the citations (e.g., [27]) from the response before sending this as a final response to the user of your application.

You can also find more examples of prompt chaining in this [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-chaining) that leverages the Claude LLM. Our example is inspired and adapted from their examples.


# PAL (Program-Aided Language Models)
 
import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import {Screenshot} from 'components/screenshot'
import PAL from '../../img/pal.png'

[Gao et al., (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435) presents a method that uses LLMs to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps. Coined, program-aided language models (PAL), it differs from chain-of-thought prompting in that instead of using free-form text to obtain solution it offloads the solution step to a programmatic runtime such as a Python interpreter.

Let's look at an example using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-3. We are interested to develop a simple application that's able to interpret the question being asked and provide an answer by leveraging the Python interpreter. 

Specifically, we are interested to create a functionality that allows the use of the LLM to answer questions that require date understanding. We will provide the LLM a prompt that includes a few exemplars which are adopted from [here](https://github.com/reasoning-machines/pal/blob/main/pal/prompt/date_understanding_prompt.py).  

These are the imports we need:

```python
import openai
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

Let's first configure a few things:

```python
load_dotenv()

# API configuration
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# for LangChain
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

Setup model instance:

```python
llm = OpenAI(model_name='text-davinci-003', temperature=0)
```

Setup prompt + question:

```python
question = "Today is 27 February 2023. I was born exactly 25 years ago. What is the date I was born in MM/DD/YYYY?"

DATE_UNDERSTANDING_PROMPT = """
# Q: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then today is 36 hours before.
today = datetime(2015, 1, 1) - relativedelta(hours=36)
# One week from today,
one_week_from_today = today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
one_week_from_today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019, then today is 6 days later.
today = datetime(2019, 1, 1) + relativedelta(days=6)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: The concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If the concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today, then today is one day later.
today = datetime(1943, 6, 1) + relativedelta(days=1)
# 10 days ago,
ten_days_ago = today - relativedelta(days=10)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
ten_days_ago.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: It is 4/19/1969 today. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?
# It is 4/19/1969 today.
today = datetime(1969, 4, 19)
# 24 hours later,
later = today + relativedelta(hours=24)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, but today is in fact Mar 12, which is 1 day later. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, but today is in fact Mar 12, then today is 3/12/2002.
today = datetime(2002, 3, 12)
# 24 hours later,
later = today + relativedelta(hours=24)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
later.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001 and today is her 16-year-old birthday, then today is 16 years later.
today = datetime(2001, 2, 28) + relativedelta(years=16)
# Yesterday,
yesterday = today - relativedelta(days=1)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
yesterday.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: {question}
""".strip() + '\n'
```

```python
llm_out = llm(DATE_UNDERSTANDING_PROMPT.format(question=question))
print(llm_out)
```

This will output the following:
```
# If today is 27 February 2023 and I was born exactly 25 years ago, then I was born 25 years before.
today = datetime(2023, 2, 27)
# I was born 25 years before,
born = today - relativedelta(years=25)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
born.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
```

The contents of `llm_out` are a Python code snippet. Below, the `exec` command is used to execute this Python code snippet.
```python
exec(llm_out)
print(born)
```

This will output the following: `02/27/1998`


# Multimodal CoT Prompting

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import {Screenshot} from 'components/screenshot'
import MCOT from '../../img/multimodal-cot.png'

[Zhang et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00923) recently proposed a multimodal chain-of-thought prompting approach. Traditional CoT focuses on the language modality. In contrast, Multimodal CoT incorporates text and vision into a two-stage framework. The first step involves rationale generation based on multimodal information. This is followed by the second phase, answer inference, which leverages the informative generated rationales.

The multimodal CoT model (1B) outperforms GPT-3.5 on the ScienceQA benchmark.

# Generated Knowledge Prompting

import {Screenshot} from 'components/screenshot'

<Screenshot src={GENKNOW} alt="GENKNOW" />

LLMs continue to be improved and one popular technique includes the ability to incorporate knowledge or information to help the model make more accurate predictions. 

Using a similar idea, can the model also be used to generate knowledge before making a prediction? That's what is attempted in the paper by [Liu et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08387.pdf) -- generate knowledge to be used as part of the prompt. In particular, how helpful is this for tasks such as commonsense reasoning?

Let's try a simple prompt:

*Prompt:*
```
Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others. Yes or No?
```

*Output:*
```
Yes.
```

This type of mistake reveals the limitations of LLMs to perform tasks that require more knowledge about the world. How do we improve this with knowledge generation?

First, we generate a few "knowledges":

*Prompt:*
```
Input: Greece is larger than mexico.
Knowledge: Greece is approximately 131,957 sq km, while Mexico is approximately 1,964,375 sq km, making Mexico 1,389% larger than Greece.

Input: Glasses always fog up.
Knowledge: Condensation occurs on eyeglass lenses when water vapor from your sweat, breath, and ambient humidity lands on a cold surface, cools, and then changes into tiny drops of liquid, forming a film that you see as fog. Your lenses will be relatively cool compared to your breath, especially when the outside air is cold.

Input: A fish is capable of thinking.
Knowledge: Fish are more intelligent than they appear. In many areas, such as memory, their cognitive powers match or exceed those of ’higher’ vertebrates including non-human primates. Fish’s long-term memories help them keep track of complex social relationships.

Input: A common effect of smoking lots of cigarettes in one’s lifetime is a higher than normal chance of getting lung cancer.
Knowledge: Those who consistently averaged less than one cigarette per day over their lifetime had nine times the risk of dying from lung cancer than never smokers. Among people who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes per day, the risk of dying from lung cancer was nearly 12 times higher than that of never smokers.

Input: A rock is the same size as a pebble.
Knowledge: A pebble is a clast of rock with a particle size of 4 to 64 millimetres based on the Udden-Wentworth scale of sedimentology. Pebbles are generally considered larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than cobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter).

Input: Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others.
Knowledge:
```

*Knowledge 1:*
```
The objective of golf is to play a set of holes in the least number of strokes. A round of golf typically consists of 18 holes. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard golf course. Each stroke is counted as one point, and the total number of strokes is used to determine the winner of the game.
```

*Knowledge 2:*
```
Golf is a precision club-and-ball sport in which competing players (or golfers) use many types of clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course using the fewest number of strokes. The goal is to complete the course with the lowest score, which is calculated by adding up the total number of strokes taken on each hole. The player with the lowest score wins the game.
```

We are using the prompt provided in the paper by [Liu et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08387.pdf).

The next step is to integrate the knowledge and get a prediction. I reformatted the question into QA format to guide the answer format.

*Prompt:*
```
Question: Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others. Yes or No?

Knowledge: The objective of golf is to play a set of holes in the least number of strokes. A round of golf typically consists of 18 holes. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard golf course. Each stroke is counted as one point, and the total number of strokes is used to determine the winner of the game.

Explain and Answer: 
```

*Answer 1 (confidence very high):*
```
No, the objective of golf is not to get a higher point total than others. Rather, the objective is to play a set of holes in the least number of strokes. The total number of strokes is used to determine the winner of the game, not the total number of points.
```

```
Question: Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others. Yes or No?

Knowledge: Golf is a precision club-and-ball sport in which competing players (or golfers) use many types of clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course using the fewest number of strokes. The goal is to complete the course with the lowest score, which is calculated by adding up the total number of strokes taken on each hole. The player with the lowest score wins the game.

Explain and Answer:
```

*Answer 2 (confidence is a lot lower):*
```
Yes, part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others. Each player tries to complete the course with the lowest score, which is calculated by adding up the total number of strokes taken on each hole. The player with the lowest score wins the game.
```

Some really interesting things happened with this example. In the first answer, the model was very confident but in the second not so much. I simplified the process for demonstration purposes but there are a few more details to consider when arriving at the final answer. Check out the paper for more.

# Few-Shot Prompting

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

While large-language models demonstrate remarkable zero-shot capabilities, they still fall short on more complex tasks when using the zero-shot setting. Few-shot prompting can be used as a technique to enable in-context learning where we provide demonstrations in the prompt to steer the model to better performance. The demonstrations serve as conditioning for subsequent examples where we would like the model to generate a response.

According to [Touvron et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf) few shot properties first appeared when models were scaled to a sufficient size [(Kaplan et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361).

Let's demonstrate few-shot prompting via an example that was presented in [Brown et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). In the example, the task is to correctly use a new word in a sentence.

*Prompt:*
```markdown
A "whatpu" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is:
We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus.

To do a "farduddle" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses the word farduddle is:
```

*Output:*
```
When we won the game, we all started to farduddle in celebration.
```

We can observe that the model has somehow learned how to perform the task by providing it with just one example (i.e., 1-shot). For more difficult tasks, we can experiment with increasing the demonstrations (e.g., 3-shot, 5-shot, 10-shot, etc.).

Following the findings from [Min et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12837), here are a few more tips about demonstrations/exemplars when doing few-shot:

- "the label space and the distribution of the input text specified by the demonstrations are both important (regardless of whether the labels are correct for individual inputs)"
- the format you use also plays a key role in performance, even if you just use random labels, this is much better than no labels at all.  
- additional results show that selecting random labels from a true distribution of labels (instead of a uniform distribution) also helps.

Let's try out a few examples. Let's first try an example with random labels (meaning the labels Negative and Positive are randomly assigned to the inputs):

*Prompt:*
```
This is awesome! // Negative
This is bad! // Positive
Wow that movie was rad! // Positive
What a horrible show! //
```

*Output:*
```
Negative
```

We still get the correct answer, even though the labels have been randomized. Note that we also kept the format, which helps too. In fact, with further experimentation, it seems the newer GPT models we are experimenting with are becoming more robust to even random formats. Example:

*Prompt:*
```
Positive This is awesome! 
This is bad! Negative
Wow that movie was rad!
Positive
What a horrible show! --
```

*Output:*
```
Negative
```

There is no consistency in the format above but the model still predicted the correct label. We have to conduct a more thorough analysis to confirm if this holds for different and more complex tasks, including different variations of prompts.

### Limitations of Few-shot Prompting

Standard few-shot prompting works well for many tasks but is still not a perfect technique, especially when dealing with more complex reasoning tasks. Let's demonstrate why this is the case. Do you recall the previous example where we provided the following task:

```
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. 

A: 
```

If we try this again, the model outputs the following:

```
Yes, the odd numbers in this group add up to 107, which is an even number.
```

This is not the correct response, which not only highlights the limitations of these systems but that there is a need for more advanced prompt engineering. 

Let's try to add some examples to see if few-shot prompting improves the results.

*Prompt:*
```
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.
A: The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17,  10, 19, 4, 8, 12, 24.
A: The answer is True.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 16,  11, 14, 4, 8, 13, 24.
A: The answer is True.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17,  9, 10, 12, 13, 4, 2.
A: The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. 
A: 
```

*Output:*
```
The answer is True.
```

That didn't work. It seems like few-shot prompting is not enough to get reliable responses for this type of reasoning problem. The example above provides basic information on the task. If you take a closer look, the type of task we have introduced involves a few more reasoning steps. In other words, it might help if we break the problem down into steps and demonstrate that to the model. More recently, [chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) has been popularized to address more complex arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

Overall, it seems that providing examples is useful for solving some tasks. When zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting are not sufficient, it might mean that whatever was learned by the model isn't enough to do well at the task. From here it is recommended to start thinking about fine-tuning your models or experimenting with more advanced prompting techniques. Up next we talk about one of the popular prompting techniques called chain-of-thought prompting which has gained a lot of popularity.

# Directional Stimulus Prompting

import DSP from '../../img/dsp.jpeg'

[Li et al., (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11520) proposes a new prompting technique to better guide the LLM in generating the desired summary.

A tuneable policy LM is trained to generate the stimulus/hint. Seeing more use of RL to optimize LLMs.

The figure below shows how Directional Stimulus Prompting compares with standard prompting. The policy LM can be small and optimized to generate the hints that guide a black-box frozen LLM.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

<Screenshot src={COT} alt="COT" />

Image Source: [Wei et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)

Introduced in [Wei et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding.

*Prompt:*
```
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.
A: Adding all the odd numbers (9, 15, 1) gives 25. The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17,  10, 19, 4, 8, 12, 24.
A: Adding all the odd numbers (17, 19) gives 36. The answer is True.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 16,  11, 14, 4, 8, 13, 24.
A: Adding all the odd numbers (11, 13) gives 24. The answer is True.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17,  9, 10, 12, 13, 4, 2.
A: Adding all the odd numbers (17, 9, 13) gives 39. The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. 
A:
```

*Output:*
```
Adding all the odd numbers (15, 5, 13, 7, 1) gives 41. The answer is False.
```

Wow! We can see a perfect result when we provided the reasoning step. In fact, we can solve this task by providing even fewer examples, i.e., just one example seems enough:

*Prompt:*
```
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.
A: Adding all the odd numbers (9, 15, 1) gives 25. The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. 
A:
```

*Output:*
```
Adding all the odd numbers (15, 5, 13, 7, 1) gives 41. The answer is False.
```

Keep in mind that the authors claim that this is an emergent ability that arises with sufficiently large language models.

## Zero-shot COT Prompting

<Screenshot src={ZEROCOT} alt="Zero-shot COT" />

Image Source: [Kojima et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)

One recent idea that came out more recently is the idea of [zero-shot CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916) (Kojima et al. 2022) that essentially involves adding "Let's think step by step" to the original prompt. Let's try a simple problem and see how the model performs:

*Prompt:*
```
I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?
```

*Output:*
```
11 apples
```

The answer is incorrect! Now Let's try with the special prompt. 

*Prompt:*
```
I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?

Let's think step by step.
```

*Output:*
```
First, you started with 10 apples.
You gave away 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman, so you had 6 apples left.
Then you bought 5 more apples, so now you had 11 apples.
Finally, you ate 1 apple, so you would remain with 10 apples.
```

It's impressive that this simple prompt is effective at this task. This is particularly useful where you don't have too many examples to use in the prompt.

## Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT)

When applying chain-of-thought prompting with demonstrations, the process involves hand-crafting effective and diverse examples. This manual effort could lead to suboptimal solutions. [Zhang et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03493) propose an approach to eliminate manual efforts by leveraging LLMs with "Let's think step by step" prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one. This automatic process can still end up with mistakes in generated chains. To mitigate the effects of the mistakes, the diversity of demonstrations matter. This work proposes Auto-CoT, which samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct the demonstrations. 

Auto-CoT consists of two main stages:

- Stage 1): **question clustering**: partition questions of a given dataset into a few clusters
- Stage 2): **demonstration sampling**: select a representative question from each cluster and generate its reasoning chain using Zero-Shot-CoT with simple heuristics

The simple heuristics could be length of questions (e.g., 60 tokens) and number of steps in rationale (e.g., 5 reasoning steps). This encourages the model to use simple and accurate demonstrations.  

The process is illustrated below:

Code for Auto-CoT is available [here](https://github.com/amazon-science/auto-cot).


# Self-Consistency

Perhaps one of the more advanced techniques out there for prompt engineering is self-consistency. Proposed by [Wang et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171), self-consistency aims "to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting". The idea is to sample multiple, diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT, and use the generations to select the most consistent answer. This helps to boost the performance of CoT prompting on tasks involving arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.

Let's try the following example for arithmetic reasoning:

*Prompt:*
```
When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now
I’m 70 how old is my sister?
```

*Output:*
```
35
```

The output is wrong! How may we improve this with self-consistency? Let's try it out. We will use the few-shot exemplars from Wang et al. 2022 (Table 17):

*Prompt:*
```
Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done,
there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
A: We start with 15 trees. Later we have 21 trees. The difference must be the number of trees they planted.
So, they must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees. The answer is 6.

Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
A: There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars. The answer is 5.

Q: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
A: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74
chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.

Q: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops
did Jason give to Denny?
A: Jason had 20 lollipops. Since he only has 12 now, he must have given the rest to Denny. The number of
lollipops he has given to Denny must have been 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops. The answer is 8.

Q: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does
he have now?
A: He has 5 toys. He got 2 from mom, so after that he has 5 + 2 = 7 toys. Then he got 2 more from dad, so
in total he has 7 + 2 = 9 toys. The answer is 9.

Q: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from
monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
A: There are 4 days from monday to thursday. 5 computers were added each day. That means in total 4 * 5 =
20 computers were added. There were 9 computers in the beginning, so now there are 9 + 20 = 29 computers.
The answer is 29.

Q: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many
golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
A: Michael initially had 58 balls. He lost 23 on Tuesday, so after that he has 58 - 23 = 35 balls. On
Wednesday he lost 2 more so now he has 35 - 2 = 33 balls. The answer is 33.

Q: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
A: She bought 5 bagels for $3 each. This means she spent $15. She has $8 left.

Q: When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now I’m 70 how old is my sister?
A:
```

*Output 1:*
```
When I was 6 my sister was half my age, so she was 3. Now I am 70, so she is 70 - 3 = 67. The answer is 67.
```

*Output 2:*
```
When the narrator was 6, his sister was half his age, which is 3. Now that the narrator is 70, his sister would be 70 - 3 = 67 years old. The answer is 67.
```

*Output 3:*
```
When I was 6 my sister was half my age, so she was 3. Now I am 70, so she is 70/2 = 35. The answer is 35.
```

Computing for the final answer involves a few steps (check out the paper for the details) but for the sake of simplicity, we can see that there is already a majority answer emerging so that would essentially become the final answer. 

# Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)

Combining CoT prompting and tools in an interleaved manner has shown to be a strong and robust approach to address many tasks with LLMs. These approaches typically require hand-crafting task-specific demonstrations and carefully scripted interleaving of model generations with tool use. [Paranjape et al., (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09014) propose a new framework that uses a frozen LLM to automatically generate intermediate reasoning steps as a program.

ART works as follows:
- given a new task, it select demonstrations of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library 
- at test time, it pauses generation whenever external tools are called, and integrate their output before resuming generation

ART encourages the model to generalize from demonstrations to decompose a new task and
use tools in appropriate places, in a zero-shot fashion. In addition, ART is extensible as it also enables humans to fix mistakes in the reasoning steps or add new tools by simply updating the task and tool libraries. The process is demonstrated below:

ART substantially improves over few-shot prompting and automatic CoT on unseen tasks in the BigBench and MMLU benchmarks, and exceeds performance of hand-crafted CoT prompts when human feedback is incorporated. 

Below is a table demonstrating ART's performance on BigBench and MMLU tasks:

[Zhou et al., (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910) propose automatic prompt engineer (APE) a framework for automatic instruction generation and selection. The instruction generation problem is framed as natural language synthesis addressed as a black-box optimization problem using LLMs to generate and search over candidate solutions.

The first step involves a large language model (as an inference model) that is given output demonstrations to generate instruction candidates for a task. These candidate solutions will guide the search procedure. The instructions are executed using a target model, and then the most appropriate instruction is selected based on computed evaluation scores.

APE discovers a better zero-shot CoT prompt than the human engineered "Let's think step by step" prompt ([Kojima et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)).

The prompt "Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer." elicits chain-of-thought reasoning and improves performance on the MultiArith and GSM8K benchmarks:

This paper touches on an important topic related to prompt engineering which is the idea of automatically optimizing prompts. While we don't go deep into this topic in this guide, here are a few key papers if you are interested in the topic:

- [Prompt-OIRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553) - proposes to use offline inverse reinforcement learning to generate query-dependent prompts.
- [OPRO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409) - introduces the idea of using LLMs to optimize prompts: let LLMs "Take a deep breath" improves the performance on math problems.
- [AutoPrompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15980) - proposes an approach to automatically create prompts for a diverse set of tasks based on gradient-guided search.
- [Prefix Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00190) - a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning that prepends a trainable continuous prefix for NLG tasks.
- [Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691) - proposes a mechanism for learning soft prompts through backpropagation.


# Active-Prompt

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import {Screenshot} from 'components/screenshot'
import ACTIVE from '../../img/active-prompt.png'

Chain-of-thought (CoT) methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars. The problem with this is that the exemplars might not be the most effective examples for the different tasks. To address this, [Diao et al., (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12246.pdf) recently proposed a new prompting approach called Active-Prompt to adapt LLMs to different task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning).

Below is an illustration of the approach. The first step is to query the LLM with or without a few CoT examples. *k* possible answers are generated for a set of training questions. An uncertainty metric is calculated based on the *k* answers (disagreement used). The most uncertain questions are selected for annotation by humans. The new annotated exemplars are then used to infer each question.
